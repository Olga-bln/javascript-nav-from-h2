        <h1>Happy Text</h1>
        <h3>by Bob Ross</h3>
        <h2>Work that paint</h2>
        <p>Work that paint. Brown is such a nice color. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Poor old tree. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. You can create anything that makes you happy. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. We need dark in order to show light. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Zip. That easy. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.</p>
        <h2>I'm a water fanatic</h2>
        <p>I'm a water fanatic. I love water. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. You can do anything your heart can imagine. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. There we are. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Trees grow however makes them happy.</p>
        <h2>I'm sort of a softy</h2>
        <p>I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let your imagination be your guide. Here's another little happy bush That's crazy. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. The least little bit can do so much. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. There he comes.</p>
        <h2>Even trees need a friend</h2>
        <p>Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Isn't that fantastic? That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. And maybe, maybe, maybe... We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. We'll put a happy little sky in here.</p>
        <h2>We're like drug dealers</h2>
        <p>We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. This is truly an almighty mountain. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. With practice comes confidence. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. What the devil. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Let's get wild today. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.</p>
